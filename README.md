# Universal-Discord-Updater

I was tired of waiting for the latest version of discord to come to my package manager or having to move files around from the .tar.gz so I made a script to do it automatically

Just make sure you have the latest version of discord-0.0.xx.tar.gz in ~/Downloads and run this script from anywhere on your system, it'll do the rest
